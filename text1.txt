The character segmentation of handwritten
manuscripts often presents complicated tasks. There are
many factors that cause such segmentation difficult, such as
inconsistencies in the slope, slant, length and width of each
character, as well as intersections of two characters from
either the same or different lines. This paper proposes a new
approach that combines statistical and structural analyses to
generate the Javanese scripts from line segmentation of
Javanese manuscript image. Every time a new manuscript is
discovered, all objects that make up the characters in the
manuscript are identified using interconnecting operation to
identify the components of the script. Each object that is
interconnected is given the same label. The next task is to
calculate the average height and average width of each object
that has been given the same label and its standard deviation.
This information is used to guide the average normality of a
script, i.e. when a character has a height or width that exceeds
the average value plus the standard deviation, it can be
concluded that the character in question in fact consists of two
characters that touch each other. In regard to normalizing a
skewed cluster of scripts, the task is to straighten the script in
such a way that it becomes perpendicular. The experiment
was done using 13 line images from different authors with
different writing styles, and the result shows an 88.19%
segmentation accuracy. It can be concluded that the proposed
approach to segmentation method is relatively a success when
applied on the Javanese handwritten characters.
