Sentiment analysis is the computational
study of opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes,
views and emotions expressed in text. It refers to
a classification problem where the main focus is to
predict the polarity of words and then classify them
into positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis
over Twitter offers people a fast and effective
way to measure the public’s feelings towards their
party and politicians. The primary issue in previous
sentiment analysis techniques is the determination
of the most appropriate classifier for a given classification
problem. If one classifier is chosen from the
available classifiers, then there is no surety in the
best performance on unseen data. So to reduce the
risk of selecting an inappropriate classifier, we are
combining the outputs of a set of classifiers. Thus in
this paper, we use an approach that automatically
classifies the sentiment of tweets by combining machine
learning classifiers with lexicon based classifier.
The new combination of classifiers are SentiWordNet
classifier, naive bayes classifier and hidden markov
model classifier. Here positivity or negativity of each
tweet is determined by using the majority voting
principle on the result of these three classifiers.
Thus we were used this sentiment classifier for
finding political sentiment from real time tweets.
Thus we have got an improved accuracy in sentiment
analysis using classifier ensemble Approach. Our
method also uses negation handling and word sense
disambiguation to achieve high accuracy.
