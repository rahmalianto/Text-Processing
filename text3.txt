The World Wide Web has evolved very drastically 
and the recent advent in social networking and media rich
websites has necessitated analysis of the social networks and
opinions expressed by various users in media like blogs, tweets,
and website pages alike. While a lot of previous researches have 
been done on product / CRM domain, relatively few research has
been done on the network analysis of social media with a focus on
extraction and opinion of e-Health data i.e. data expressed in
various blogs or website pages by users regarding various aspects
of their health. While marketing and medical companies can 
leverage this data to augment customer reach and thus further
their profits, sentiment analysis and network analysis on the data 
can help various organizations understand health patterns,
address people's concerns or predict outbreak patterns in case of 
contagious diseases. This paper outlines the machine learning
techniques which are helpful in the analysis of medical domain 
data from Social networks. In this paper we compare the existing 
techniques of machine learning, discuss the advantages and 
challenges encompassing the perspectives involving the use of text 
mining methods for application in E-health and madicine. We
Evaluate medical domain data classification efficiency using 
various metrics like ROC, AUC implemented via R language
packages. We need to infer which machine learning technique is 
more relevant for processing data from social networks having 
medical terms in it.
