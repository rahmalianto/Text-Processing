Music is closely related to human psychology. A piece
of music often associated with certain adjectives such as happy,
sad, romantic, and so on. The linkage between the music with a
certain mood has been widely used in various occasions by people
and music classification based on relevance to a particular
emotion is important. This research concerns with music
classification system based on mood parameters using K-Nearest
Neighbor classification method and Self Organizing Map. The
mood parameters used is based on Robert Thayer's energy-stress
model which are exuberance / happy, contentment / relax,
anxious and depression. Features that are used are rhythm
patterns of the music. The system built has additional facility
that that can play songs according to mood chosen. The system is
tested using a set of kid song and can show the number of
clusters and the mood of a song collection. Classification results
obtained by the two classification methods, the K-Nearest
Neighbor and Self Organizing Map, are compared with the mood
obtained by child psychology experts.
